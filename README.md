# Relic Valuation

This repo is all about Warframe and giving a value to each relic. Trying to value relics in warframe requires remembering not only the names of each relic, but also its rare drop. This is cumbersome and thus I have automated the process of looking up the value for each relic. This project was undertaken using Google Sheets and this is simply a dump for the code used since I am too lazy to publish.

## Getting Started

* Make new Google Sheet
* Go to tools > script editor
* Paste code from Prod.js
* Go back to sheet and fill in a relics name and rare item drop
* In a separate cell use =valueitem(the_cell)

### Prerequisites

Google Sheets.
